## Metacopy

Using [metacopy](https://github.com/lisandra-dev/obsidian-metacopy), you can quickly copy a link to a shared page. To create a link, you need to configure:
 1. `category` in `key`
 2. Add your `set_url` in `base link`
 3. Add `category` in `key link`

You can also remove metacopy from the file menu using a key, so you can activate metacopy only for `share: true`. Metacopy also supports the [[customization#Folder note|folder note]].

The final configuration of metacopy will be:

![](../assets/img/metacopy2.png)

In the end, a menu will appear on files with `share: true` and a configured `category`. This menu is on the left-click and the file menu. You can quickly copy a link from there, like a Google or Notion sharing link!
