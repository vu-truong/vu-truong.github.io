Today's update is simple! It adds some commands to the file menu and editor menu.

Firstly, you can now share an entire folder. The plugin will scan the shared files in the selected folder and upload any files found.

Secondly, I have included the option to share to another repository. Since I have implemented the new submenu system, it won't clutter your right-click!

> [!note] The repository you set in shortcuts will also appear in this menu!
